# SOLID

## S - Single responsibility

#### This principle states that a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.

## O - Open for extension. closed for modification

#### Simply put, classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs in an otherwise happy application.

## L - Liskov substitution

#### Simply put, if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.

## I - Interface segregation

####  It simply means that larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones. By doing so, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.

## D - Dependency inversion

#### The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules. This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.
